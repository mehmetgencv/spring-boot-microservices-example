# Microservices Project

Welcome to our Microservices Project! This project aims to build a scalable and modular system using microservices architecture. Below is a high-level roadmap outlining the key features and technologies involved:

## Todo List

1. **Customer Service and PostgreSQL Integration:** -> Completed
    - Implement the Customer Service microservice.
    - Establish a connection to PostgreSQL for efficient data storage and retrieval.

2. **Fraud Service and MongoDB Integration:** -> Completed
    - Develop the Fraud Service microservice.
    - Integrate MongoDB to store and manage fraud-related data.

3. **Notification Service:**
    - Create the Notification Service microservice to handle communication and alerts.
    - Implement various notification mechanisms for enhanced user engagement.

4. **RabbitMQ Integration:**
    - Incorporate RabbitMQ as a message broker for inter-service communication.
    - Ensure seamless communication and coordination between microservices.

5. **Kafka Integration:**
    - Integrate Kafka for real-time event streaming and data processing.
    - Leverage Kafka's distributed architecture for scalability and fault tolerance.

6. **Containerization:**
    - Utilize containerization (e.g., Docker) to package microservices and their dependencies.
    - Streamline deployment and scalability with container orchestration tools like Kubernetes.

## Getting Started

 Follow the instructions below to set up and run the microservices project on your local environment.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
    ```

2. Set up and configure the required services (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, RabbitMQ, Kafka). This may involve:

    - Installing and configuring PostgreSQL, MongoDB, RabbitMQ, and Kafka on your local machine or using containerized versions.

    - Ensuring the necessary dependencies and libraries are installed.

3. Build and run each microservice independently. Navigate to each microservice's directory and follow the specific instructions for building and running.

4. Test the communication between microservices and ensure the system functions as intended.

 For detailed instructions and documentation, refer to the individual folders of each microservice.
